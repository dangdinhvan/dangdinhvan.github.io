    <p id="paragrap1">Everybody has a plan for future. Though future is uncertain and many times unpredictable, I
        believe that to some extent our future depends on our actions on past and present. In the future, I want to run
        a mega shopping mall business where my involvement would not be mandatory to run the daily business and I would
        enjoy my time by visiting different places of the world.</p>
    <p id="paragrap2">After I finished my graduation, I started working for a small company. Now I am working for a
        large multinational company I have planned to work till I become 36 and then I will take early retirement. The
        money I will inherit and the amount I am currently saving per month should allow me to start a business. I have
        planned to start a big shopping mall. I will have my close relatives as the employees and authorities of the
        business and initially I will work in this shopping mall for 2-3 years to make it run smoothly. When the
        business would go on with its own path, I will enjoy my vacation and would visit different renowned and
        beautiful cities of the world. I will visit Asia, Europe, Russia and many more places.</p>
    <p id="paragrap3">Hopefully, I will enjoy the retirement and the trips. Though I am not sure about the future but I
        have already planned for it. Because I believe proper planning and initiation is the half of the total task and
        fulfilling dream. I have already taken some steps towards achieving my future plan.</p>
